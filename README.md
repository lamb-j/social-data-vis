# Social Data Analysis and Visualization of A Song of Ice and Fire



In this study, we analyze the characters from George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire book universe. Specifically, we want to use various methods of text and data analysis, as well as visualizations, to detect patterns in relationships between characters. Our main methods consist of word frequency visualization using word clouds, character frequency visualization by using a linear timeline graph, static and dynamic social network construction to visualize relationships, and a Naïve Bayes machine learning classifier to predict what these patterns and relationships may implicate about the future of the series. Although our study focuses on a fictional universe, the methods used can easily be generalized to a real-world data set.

## Context

This project was developed as the final project of the course (02806) Social Data Analysis and Visualization, taught by Andrea Cuttone at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Spring 2014.
